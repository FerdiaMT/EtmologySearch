# Etymology Search

A React-based web application that allows users to input a sentence and highlights the etymology origin of each word <br> (What language the given word originated from). <br>
The app fetches data from a custom Flask API I built, which scrapes etymology information from <a href="www.etymonline.com">etymonline.com<a>.

**Features**:

- Input a sentence and see the etymology of each word highlighted.

- Fetches data from a custom Flask API.

- Clean and responsive UI built with React.
